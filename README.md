# Qurani_App

### 📱 Excited to share my first Flutter app project - "Quarani"! 🕌📚
#### 📖 Quranic Chapters and Verses: 🔸 With "Quarani," users can access the entire Quran, complete with audio recitations and text for each chapter and verse. 
#### 💡 Individual Ayah Learning: 🔸 We understand the significance of memorizing the Quran, so we've integrated features that allow users to focus on individual ayahs for enhanced learning.
#### 🙏 Ad3iaa (Supplications) and Prayer Times: 🔸 "Quarani" goes beyond just Quranic content. It also includes an ad3iaa .Additionally, the app provides accurate prayer times based on the user's location, ensuring they never miss a prayer.
